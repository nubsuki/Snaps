# Snaps - Simple System Tray Screenshot Tool for Wayland

## Set Your Default File Manager (optional)

If your screenshots folder opens in the wrong app (like VSCode instead of your file manager), you can set your default file manager manually:

```bash
ls /usr/share/applications | grep -i nautilus
# Example output:
# nautilus-autorun-software.desktop
# org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop

xdg-mime default org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop inode/directory
```

Replace `org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop` with the desktop file for your preferred file manager if different.
